- `auto_regressive_mnist.ipynb`
    - Contains code for training an autoregressive generative model on the MNIST dataset
    - Uses **FVSBN (Fully Visible Sigmoid Belief Network)**
        - Simple pixel-wise autoregressive model
        - Pixel `i` depends on all previous pixels in a fixed ordering
        - Separate model is trained for each pixel
        - No parameter sharing across pixels
        - Performs well when training data contains only a single digit
        - Fails when trained on multiple digits
            - Learns a shortcut by modeling only one dominant digit
            - Maximizes likelihood / minimizes negative log-likelihood without capturing full data diversity
        - Suffers from parameter explosion due to lack of parameter sharing
        - Requires a strict ordering of pixels
